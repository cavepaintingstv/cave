<p style="font-size:15px">I'm back.<br><br>

As some of you may know, I moved to France in early 2019 to be an animator on the upcoming animated show 'Sardine de l'espace'.<br>
Well, my work there is now complete! We wrapped up in late December and I have returned to the UK to work on my own independent shorts for the time being.
With a few ups and downs (like being fucking burgled <b>twice</b>) I had a lot of fun over in France and made a lot of wonderful and creative friends whom I hold dear to my heart.
<br><br>
Thanks for bearing with me while I get more comfortably situated in order to release more animated content for you all. A man's gotta eat, and live. To an extent.
